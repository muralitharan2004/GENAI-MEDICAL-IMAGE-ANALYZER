# GenAI Medical Image Analyzer

## Overview
The GenAI Medical Image Analyzer is a cutting-edge AI-powered tool designed for analyzing medical images with precision and efficiency. Leveraging state-of-the-art generative AI and deep learning techniques, this tool assists medical professionals in identifying patterns, diagnosing conditions, and generating actionable insights from complex medical imaging data.

## Features
- **Automated Image Analysis**: Supports X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and more.
- **AI-Powered Diagnostics**: Provides probabilistic insights into potential conditions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Heatmaps and overlays highlight areas of interest.
- **Customizable Models**: Fine-tune or integrate your own AI models.
- **Data Privacy**: Complies with HIPAA and other medical data protection regulations.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Hardware**: GPU-enabled system recommended (NVIDIA CUDA support preferred).
- **Libraries**: The following Python libraries are required:
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Flask or FastAPI (for serving the model)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/genai-medical-analyzer.git
   cd genai-medical-analyzer
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure your GPU drivers and CUDA are properly configured (if applicable).

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Images**:
   Place your medical images in the `data/input/` folder.
2. **Run Analysis**:
   Use the following command to analyze the images:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py --input data/input/ --output results/
   ```
3. **View Results**:
   - Raw results will be saved in the `results/` folder.
   - Use the visualization tool:
     ```bash
     python visualize.py --input results/
     ```
4. **Serve via API** (optional):
   Start the web server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the web app at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Configuration
Edit the `config.yaml` file to adjust settings such as:
- Model paths
- Thresholds for detection
- Output formats

## Example
### Input:
![Sample Input](input/io.png)

### Output:
![Sample Output](output/ou1.png)
![Sample Output](output/ou2.png)
![Sample Output](output/ou3.png)
![Sample Output](output/ou4.png)
